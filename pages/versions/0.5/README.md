# DOLUS V0.5

## Description:

DOLUS V0.5 (formerly known as Deceptium), was first accidentally discovered by X-88 from October to November of 2023. It was comprised of a flaw in Performance Matter's Test Locking feature, since Performance Matter's test questions are all in iframes, he decided to create a bookmarklet to inject an iframe embedded with Bing and it actually worked, he could search with Bing in the test without getting locked out!

## Flaws:

V0.5's flaws are obvious, it is not easy to use, it is divided into 3 js bookmarklets and switching to them to close the iframes or inject them is time consuming, along with the fact there's only 2 resolutions in the iframes.

## How to use:

The bookmarklet is divided into 3, the `disable.js` script removes the V0.5 iframes, the `fullscreen-version.js` injects a Bing iframe that fills 100% of the page and `smaller-version.js` creates a smaller Bing frame in the upper corner of the test page.

## Recent Updates:

As of now, DOLUS V0.5 is an archive, I recommend you use the latest versions.
