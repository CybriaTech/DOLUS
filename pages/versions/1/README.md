# DOLUS V1

## Description:

DOLUS V1 is a more refined version of Dolus V0.5 (Deceptium), it includes newer features including Google iframe integration, a much more better design, search features like forward, backward, home and refresh, window features like minimize, expand and close and most of all, its all in 1 file.

## Flaws

So far, DOLUS V1's flaws are that when closed and run again, the drag feature will not work, along with the main content's styling which is off, and depending on the website's policies, DOLUS's assets will not load. 

## How to use:

Save `dolus.min.js` or `dolus.js` as a bookmarklet, either one works.
