# DOLUS
## The first Performance Matters hack

## 🤨What is DOLUS?

DOLUS is an exploit discovered and utilized by X-88 which abuses an iframe exploit in Performance Matters which bypasses the test's locking feature.

## ❔How does it work?

It consists of a bookmarklet that injects an HTML Iframe with a search engine into a Performance Matters test. It does exactly what its name is, it tricks the test into thinking that the iframe is part of the test questions due to the fact the test questions are loaded via iframe. This will result in the test not locking you out and giving you the ability to search the web or go to web links while still in the test. It's a pretty broken cheat tool.

## 📚What can it be used on?

As of now, DOLUS can be used on Performance Matters, Schoology and other web based applications that has a test locking feature.

## 💻How can I get it?

We have currently finished 2 versions, DOLUS V0.5 and DOLUS V1, I highly recommend you use DOLUS V1 as it is much more refined than V0.5.
